  abstract={최근  증가하는  비정형  데이터를  효율적으로  관리하기  위해  키-밸류  형태로  저장되는  데이터베이스의 사용이  늘어나고  있다.  그  중  Meta의  RocksDB는  키-밸류를  더  효율적으로  관리하기  위해  Wisckey에서 제안한  키-밸류  분리  기법을  기반으로  한  BlobDB를  도입하였다.  BlobDB에서는  키만  Compaction하므로 쓰기  증폭이  감소하지만  밸류를  저장하는  Blob  File의  크기에  따라  쓰기  성능의  차이가  발생한다.  본  논문에서는  Blob File의  크기에  따라  발생하는  현상들이  어떤  것들이  있는지  실험을  통해  쓰기  지연과  파일의  Garbage  크기를  보여주고  분석을  통해  향후  연구  방향을  제시하겠다. (The use of key-value databases has been increasing to efficiently manage the growing volume of unstructured data. Among them, Meta's RocksDB has introduced BlobDB, based on the key-value separation technique proposed by Wisckey, to improve key-value management efficiency. In BlobDB, only keys are compacted, which reduces write amplification, but the write performance varies depending on the size of the Blob file used to store values. This paper investigates the effects of Blob file size through experiments, highlighting write latency and garbage size, and provides an analysis to propose directions for future research.)},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
